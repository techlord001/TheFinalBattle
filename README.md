# TheFinalBattle

The Realms of C# have been ravaged by The Uncoded One, but the time has finally come to face him in battle. Are you the one True Programmer prophesied who will bring light and hope to the Realms of C# once again?

## How to play
When you start you'll have three choices:
1. Human vs AI
2. Human vs Human
3. AI vs AI

You'll then be asked to provide a name for the True Programmer. This is the only time you'll be asked to provide a string as all other options will be integers.
